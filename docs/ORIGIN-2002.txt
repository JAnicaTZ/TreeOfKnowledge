TreeOfKnowledge – ORIGIN-2002
==============================

Author: JAnica Tesla Zrinski  
Project: “Tree of Knowledge”

Created around 2002–2004 as a Java logic-tree calculator that builds and
analyses logical formulas using a clean recursive algorithm and a hand-written
parser.

The 2025 release focuses on packaging and distribution.
The original source code is preserved (2004) and remains unchanged.

The goal of publishing this source is to enable students and researchers to
study the logic-tree methodology behind Tree of Knowledge.
